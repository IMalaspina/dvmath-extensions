# DV-Mathematics Extensions

**⚠️ WARNING: This repository contains EXPERIMENTAL and HYPOTHETICAL research. ⚠️**

**Do NOT use this code for production. Do NOT cite as established theory.**

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as a research and development space for extending the core DV-Mathematics framework. It is a place for:

- **Prototyping** higher-dimensional algebras (DV¹⁶ and beyond)
- **Exploring** hypothetical applications in physics and mathematics
- **Investigating** connections to other theoretical structures (Lie algebras, category theory)

**The primary `dvmath` repository contains validated, production-ready code. This repository contains speculative research.**

## Repository Structure

### `/dv16/` — Sedenions (Experimental)

- **`sedenion.py`**: Prototype implementation of DV¹⁶ (Sedenions).
- **Key Challenge**: Handling zero divisors and the loss of norm preservation.
- **Status**: Research Prototype. **NOT VALIDATED.**

### `/physics/` — Hypothetical Applications

- **`/quantum/`**: Explores DV-based representations of quantum states.
- **`/spacetime/`**: Investigates potential applications to spacetime metrics.
- **Status**: Purely speculative. **NOT VALIDATED.**

### `/theory/` — Theoretical Connections

- **`/lie_algebras/`**: Investigates commutator structures in DV⁸ and their connection to Lie algebras (e.g., G₂).
- **`/category_theory/`**: Explores formalizing the DV hierarchy as a functorial construction.
- **Status**: Theoretical exploration. **NOT VALIDATED.**

### `/examples/` — Experimental Demonstrations

- Contains code examples demonstrating the concepts in this repository.
- **WARNING**: These examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not validated.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this repository are welcome, but must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Label Everything**: All code, documentation, and results **must** be clearly labeled as `EXPERIMENTAL`, `HYPOTHETICAL`, or `SPECULATIVE`.
2.  **No Hallucinations**: Do not present speculative ideas as established facts. All claims must be grounded in mathematical reasoning, even if not fully proven.
3.  **Focus on Research**: The goal is to ask questions and explore possibilities, not to create production-ready code.
4.  **Link to Core Repository**: Where possible, build upon the validated code in the main `dvmath` repository.
